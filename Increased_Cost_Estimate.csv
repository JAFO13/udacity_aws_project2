With the increased budget, I put the DB servers back to the original configuration since it was working without issue.  However, I increased the baseline, peak and instance types for both the Web Servers and the Application Servers.  The application servers now have a consistent number of 10 instances (up from 6 previously) and are now running M4.4xlarge instances with 16CPU, 64GB RAM and are designed for high network performance.  The web servers are now configured with 16CPU, 30GB RAM and also designed for high network performance.  This application should see a remarkable improvement in performance.
